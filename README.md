# Pomodoro Timer

## Description

The Pomodoro Timer is a terminal-based productivity application built using Node.js. It implements the Pomodoro Technique, which encourages focused work intervals followed by short breaks to enhance productivity and maintain mental clarity. This application allows users to customize their work and break durations, providing a simple interface to manage their time effectively.

## Features

- **Timer Functionality:** Counts down from specified durations for work sessions and breaks.
- **Customizable Durations:** Users can set their own durations for work intervals, short breaks, and long breaks.
- **Notifications:** Desktop notifications are sent for various timer states, including when a timer starts, pauses, resumes, resets, stops, or finishes.
